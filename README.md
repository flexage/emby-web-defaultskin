# emby-web-flextuary

This is a community-developed Emby Theater skin that draws inspiration on my love for the new default Kodi v17 skin, Estuary.

Whilst some parts borrow heavily on the original Kodi skin, others are just loosely based around the general feel.

# Installation

To install, first launch Emby Theater.

Then navigate to the settings, and go to the "Installed Plugins" option.

Select "Install Plugin" and then choose "Install from URL".

For the Plugin URL, enter https://flexage.github.io/emby-web-flextuary/package.json
